# Unified Form Design Changes

## Overview
The men's and ladies forms have been unified to use the same design, layout, and animations, with only color scheme differences.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Background & Layout
- Both forms now use the same background image (`fashion-store-background.jpg`)
- Same container structure and spacing
- Consistent animations across both forms

### 2. Color Schemes
#### Men's Form (Default)
- Dark theme with black/gray backgrounds
- Gold accents (#d4af37)
- White text on dark backgrounds

#### Ladies Form (.female-form)
- Light theme with white/cream backgrounds
- Rose/pink accents (#e91e63, #f8bbd0)
- Dark text on light backgrounds

### 3. CSS Updates in styles.css
- Removed ornamental palace-style decorations from female form
- Unified form sections to use same structure with different colors
- Consistent border radius (12px) and padding across both forms
- Same backdrop-filter blur effects
- Unified animations (fadeIn, fadeInUp, etc.)

### 4. JavaScript Integration
- Added `updateFormContent()` function to switch content based on gender
- Integrated `female-form-data.js` for gender-specific content
- Gender switching updates both styles and content dynamically

### 5. Specific Component Styling

#### Form Header

### 6. Female-Specific Content
The `female-form-data.js` file contains:
- Different style options (feminine, elegant, etc.)
- Women-specific avoid items
- Custom text content for titles and descriptions
- Different weekend activities

### 7. Files Modified
1. `/fs-form/styles.css` - Major updates to unify styling
2. `/fs-form/script.js` - Added content switching functionality
3. `/fs-form/index.html` - Updated script references and inline code

### 8. Test File
Created `test-unified-form.html` to verify:
- Gender switching works correctly
- Animations are consistent
- Color schemes apply properly
- Content updates dynamically

## Implementation Notes
- The female form no longer has heavy ornamental styling
- Both forms share the same modern, clean design aesthetic
- Only colors and specific content differ between forms
- All animations and transitions are identical
- Layout structure is completely unified
