# Summary of Changes Made

## 1. Fixed Pattern Selection Display (Issue #1)
- Fixed the JavaScript ID mismatch: changed `getElementById('patternSelectionSection')` to `getElementById('patternSelections')` in script.js
- Added initialization check to prevent duplicate event listeners
- Pattern selection now properly shows 5 pattern variations when any attractive style (モード, エレガント, etc.) is selected

## 2. Removed Style Preference Detail Evaluation (Issue #2)
- Removed the entire "スタイル嗜好性の詳細評価" section (lines 1752-1987) from index.html
- This section was asking for detailed evaluation of each style with gradient scales and was redundant

## 3. Fixed Item Evaluation Integration (Issue #3)
- The item evaluation (GOOD & BAD) is already integrated within each style's pattern selection
- Commented out the redundant separate "3-2. アイテムのGOOD & BAD" section (lines 1520-1568)
- Item evaluations now appear directly under each selected style's pattern variations

## Additional Fixes
- Added error checking in initializePatternSelection() to ensure required elements exist
- Prevented multiple initialization of pattern selection functionality
- The form now properly shows:
  1. Style selection (up to 3 styles)
  2. 5 pattern variations for each selected style
  3. Item evaluation (GOOD/BAD) for each selected style

## Note
There's a misplaced section "2-4. 避けたいアイテム" that appears after section 3-1. This should ideally be moved to the end of section 2, but was not addressed in this fix as it wasn't part of the requested changes.
